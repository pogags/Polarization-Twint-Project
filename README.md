# Polarization & Twint

As Americans, it can seem that we are more divided than we have ever been when it comes to politics. Anecdotally, the civil unrest of 2020 and January 6th riots at the capital point towards a public that is increasingly polarized and partisan. In this study, we look to see if we can catch any objective clues that would allow us to show numerical proof that we are truly living in more divided times.

Have we become more polarized? Why is this important?

Knowing whether a constituent is in disarray is important for political leaders and concerned citizens alike. Only by examining our political and cultural realities and having an awareness of how our fellow citizens view issues will we be able to confront societal differences and mitigate political altercations.
For this study one of the best-known political battlegrounds, Twitter, will help us answer the question: “are we more polarized?”
