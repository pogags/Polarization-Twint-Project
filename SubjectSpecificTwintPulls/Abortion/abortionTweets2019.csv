Surely there is a middle ground between the 2 sides.... ie;  abortion is fine up to 15 weeks for instance.   But surely you don‚Äôt agree that a woman in her 9th month should abort.  At that stage... SURELY.... you are on the side of adoption.

But from a judicial perspective it's completely irrelevant whether or not abortion is morally murder. Law is not morality. It's a set of rules."
