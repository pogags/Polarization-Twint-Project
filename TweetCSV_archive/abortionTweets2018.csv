Even when you've a shot angle blocked it still finds the net. Every game 5-5 or worse. Hence why they've put out this emergency patch already on PC. Fifa has been a mess since the patch."
1060308421315096581,2018-11-07 16:10:01 MST,llott13,@blake_48 AND his political stance is that women should only be able to have abortions if their life is at immediate risk which means if anything happens I may not have the freedom of choice over my OWN body and be forced to carry out a pregnancy for NINE months etc.

I think many of those reasonable people feel at home in the blue tent."

With Kavanaugh on the SC, some states have set the groundwork for an eventual ban on abortions rights should Roe v Wade be overturned."
1060308159632498689,2018-11-07 16:08:59 MST,fahe_k,I ADVOCATE for SAFE ABORTION.  Being against it has not stopped any woman willing to terminate a pregnancy at all costs from doing it.  It's either Mugo style or safe and  professional way.  SAFE ABORTION for UNWANTED PREGNANCIES.
1060308156985810944,2018-11-07 16:08:58 MST,puppyshogun,The problem with any legislation that only requires a simple majority. 48 percent are fucked by 52. That‚Äôs just stupid governing. We need to stop debating abortion and make real compromises. You aren‚Äôt the only person with an opinion.  https://t.co/EJKqt8u96k
